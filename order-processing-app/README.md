# Order processing app

This is a modified version of the Order Processing app from Unit 10 <https://github.com/corndeladmin/DevOps-Unit-10-Workshop>.

As part of [the scenario setup described here](../setup/workshop_scenario_setup.md) you will have this app already running in Azure as part of an App Service.

You shouldn't need to update the existing App Service and will instead be deploying this app to AKS.
